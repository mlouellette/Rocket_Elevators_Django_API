# Rocket_Elevators_Django_API

This application contains api requests using Python's DJANGO framework and REST. Using the facial recognition library 
you can register an employee to your database or look to see if an employee exists in the database using a picture, if that employee
exists it will return the employee's credentials.

## Usage

`python manage.py runserver`

## Url samples 

You can test different scenarios on the interface of your choice
I recommend using POSTMAN : https://www.postman.com/downloads/

- POST : http://127.0.0.1:8000/employees
- GET : http://127.0.0.1:8000/employees
- GET : http://127.0.0.1:8000/employees/recognize
